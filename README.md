## Context

One-shot learning is a powerful technique for recognizing objects with very limited examples. In this project, we apply one-shot learning to recognize Yu-Gi-Oh cards using a deep learning model. Whether you're a Yu-Gi-Oh enthusiast or just interested in computer vision and machine learning, this project can help you get started with one-shot learning.

## Card Detection and Recognition

In this project, we have divided the card recognition process into two main steps: card detection and card recognition. 

### Card Detection

To locate and identify the Yu-Gi-Oh card within an image, we have utilized OpenCV. Our current card detection approach is based on traditional computer vision techniques, there is potential for improvement by integrating AI-based recognition tools like ResNet.

Using an AI-based model, such as ResNet, for card detection could enhance the accuracy and robustness of the detection process. This approach might better handle complex scenarios, different lighting conditions, and variations in card orientations.

### Card Recognition

For the actual recognition of the Yu-Gi-Oh card, we employ AI-based techniques.
